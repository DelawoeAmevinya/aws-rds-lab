# Building and Connecting an Amazon RDS Database

I completed a hands-on lab where I:
- Launched an **Amazon RDS DB instance with Multi-AZ (high availability)**
- Configured **security groups** to securely connect my web server to the database
- Tested the setup with a **successful DB connection**
- Integrated the DB into a **web application** and performed CRUD operations

## What I did (short steps)
1. Launched RDS instance (Multi-AZ) in AWS RDS.
2. Created/updated security group to allow the web serverâ€™s IP/port.
3. Tested DB connectivity with a client (e.g., MySQL Workbench / psql).
4. Configured the web app connection string (using env var).
5. Performed CREATE/READ/UPDATE/DELETE operations through the app.
